# OneDeathForAll

This is a MC Creator implementation of a well-known private mod that's been seen in YouTube videos. For some references:

The idea goes to the makers of that mod, I just wanted to open-source my own interpretation of the mod so that it's more accessible.
(Because its MCreator... the github commits are a little wonky. But don't worry, it's still me :) )

Mod files are in the `Releases` section, using __Forge 1.17.1__ as the minecraft version.

Current features:
  * When someone dies, we all die.
      * There's a (arguably spammable) killfeed that eventually points to who killed first, with every other subsequent Player.
